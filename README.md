The code for my final MVP is shown in the Sriharsha Final MVP Folder. You can simply run main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or other program and run it. Make sure file directories stay the same. It is very important to not remove any files out in order to run the program smoothly. Look at Phase 1 and 2 folder for all the code written during my research and experimental phase where I tested with numerous machine learning models, algorithms, programs etc until I used Tensorflow Object Detection API for the best results. Check requirements.txt for all modules necessary. Tensorflow Object Detection API must be installed. Documentation can be found on their website.
